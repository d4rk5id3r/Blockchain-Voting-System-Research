# A Comparative Analysis of Decentralized Blockchain Voting Systems

## Abstract:
Decentralized Blockchain systems have gained significant attention for their potential application in various domains across different sectors, including voting systems. This paper presents a comparative analysis of different decentralized blockchain-based voting systems. It explores their architectures, security features, scalability, transparency, and usability aspects. Through this comparative analysis, the aim is to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of existing decentralized blockchain voting systems and identify areas for future research and development.

## 1. Introduction

### Background on Traditional Voting Systems:
Traditional voting systems have long been the cornerstone of democratic processes worldwide, including Nigeria. These systems typically involve the use of paper ballots, electronic voting machines, or a combination of the two. Voters cast their votes at designated polling stations. Over the years, these systems have served their purposes adequately, but like any other man-made system, they are not without flaws. Challenges such as electoral rigging, manipulation, and logistical inefficiencies have raised the need for innovation and improvements.

### Introduction To Decentralized Blockchain Technology:
Blockchain Technology has emerged as a promising solution to many of the flaws in Traditional Systems. At its core, blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and immutable record-keeping across a network of computers. In the context of voting systems, blockchain can revolutionize the way votes are casted, recorded, and verified, offering unprecedented levels of security and transparency.
